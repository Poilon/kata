## Level 3: Feynman's Squares

How many different squares are there in a grid of NxN squares?

For example, when N=2, the answer is 5: the 2x2 square itself, plus the four 1x1 squares in its corners.
For N=3, the answer will be 14.

Write a class SquareGrid, with an initialized attribute 'edge_size'.
This class will have a method feynmans_count, that will return the count of all squares in the square grid.
